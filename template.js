    "description": "The workout here follows a reverse-pyramid protocol, which allows you to take more total sets to muscle failure. It also starts with the dumbbell bench press rather than the barbell, because dumbbells are more difficult to control—extra difficulty is a good thing in this case—and allow for a greater range of motion. Many people find that just making that switch is enough to spur new growth.",

In this workout, you'll do them before the other two, while you have a bit more energy in the tank. Feel free to rearrange the order of the single-joint moves based on your weaknesses, though. If you judge your delts to be fairly balanced, simply rotate the order of the single-joint movements from one workout to the next.",

The legs are used daily for basic activities like walking, standing, going upstairs, or just getting up from a chair. What does this mean to you as a trainer? If you are looking to put size on your legs, half ass workouts will not do anything; your legs are accustomed to working all day. Only dedication to intense hard work in the gym will break down the dense thick muscle fibers of the legs and their only choice will be to get bigger and stronger. You need to force your legs to grow. Your legs will resist you. They will burn, shake and burn some more while you work out, but you need to push through and want more, as this is the only way to make your legs grow.",
    "notes": [
